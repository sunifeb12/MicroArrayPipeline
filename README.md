# **[MicroArrayPipeline](https://github.com/sunifeb12/MicroArrayPipeline)**
A open source pipeline for Microarray data analysis.

**Project Details**: 
Gene expression analysis is often carried out on Microarray data to investigate into roles of different genes which are overexpressed or under expressed at various time point. This project creates an open-source pipeline which starts from raw file reads to doing various pre-processing steps like data cleaning, averaging, aggregation, etc. The top genes which are expressed at different time points are computed out as a result. The entire pipeline uses Anaconda Python distribution and associated libraries.
